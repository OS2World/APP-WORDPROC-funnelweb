The files in this directory were those used to build funnelweb using
gcc/2 for OS/2 2.0. The header and source files are the modified
versions that I made in order to get a working version of fw.exe, the
funnelweb executable, using gcc/2 for OS/2 2.0, whereas the header and
source files in the sources directory are the originals from Ross
William's funnelweb distribution. You can recreate the patched files
using patch and the diffs in the patches.os2 file, but I include them
here anyway. The other files are as follows:

   makefile.os2 : the makefile I used to build fw.exe; it was written
                  for use with GNU make.

   fw.rsp : the link386 response file giving the object file names for
            the link step.

   fw.def : the link386 definition file for the link step in the compilation.

   make.rep : the output from GNU make for the compilation; this shows the
              warnings issued by gcc during the compilation.
