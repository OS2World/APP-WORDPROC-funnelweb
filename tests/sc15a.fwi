This is the include file for test SC15. The SC15 test checks to make
sure that FunnelWeb is saving and restoring three scanning
attributes across include files. We also want to make sure
that the scanner is initializing these attributes correctly within
the include file.

SC15.4: Make sure that the special character is AT at the start of
include files.

@    - This should yield an error.

SC15.5 Ensure that the maximum input line length is 80 at the start
of an include file. If all is well, only the second of the following two
lines will provoke a "line too long" error.

12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890

Now that we have checked the default attributes on entering an include file,
we want to stuff them up so as to make sure that the attributes
prevailing when the include was hit are restored.
