HI02: This example shows how FunnelWeb's macro facility can be used to
      fudge conditionals.

@A@<Debug Macro@>

The following macro determines whether debug code will be included in the
program. All lines of debug code commence with a call to this macro and so
we can turn all that code on or off here by defining this macro to be either
empty or the single-line comment symbol (\p{--}). Note the use of a
quick macro name.

@$@#D@M==@{@}     @! Turns the debug code ON.
@! Use this definition to turn the debug code OFF: @$@#D==@{--@}


@$@<Sloth incrementing loop@>==@{@-
while sloth<walrus loop
   @#D assert(sloth<walrus,"AWK! sloth>=walrus!!!!!!!");
   @#D assert(timer<timermax,"AWK! timer>=timermax!!!");
   inc(sloth);
end loop@}
