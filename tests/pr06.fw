@>

1. Test with no zero and no many.
@$@<Sloth@>@{No zero and no many in this macro@}

2. Test with a zero.
@$@<Sloth zero@>@Z@{Can be called from 0 to 1 times.@}

3. Test with a many.
@$@<Sloth many@>@M@{Can be called from 1 to infinity times.@}

4. Test with a zero and a many.
@$@<Sloth zeromany@>@Z@M@{Can be called from 0 to infinity times.@}

5. Test with a zero and a many but out of order (should give error).
@$@<Sloth manyzero@>@M@Z@{Oops.@}
@A@<Error recovery point@>

6. Test with syntactic errors.

@$@<Sloth a@> @M @Z @{Oops.@}
@A@<Error recovery point@>

@$@<Sloth b@>@Z@Z@{Oops.@}
@A@<Error recovery point@>

@$@<Sloth c@Z@>@{Oops.@}
@A@<Error recovery point@>

@$@<Sloth d@>Z@{Oops.@}
@A@<Error recovery point@>

@$@<Sloth d@>@ZM@{Oops.@}
