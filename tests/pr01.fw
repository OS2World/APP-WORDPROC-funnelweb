PR01: Test the inline typesetting features.

1. First we test the legal use of the @{literal@} construct.

2.Test @{@} (illegal).
@A@<Error Recovery Point@>

3. Test the construct @{across
   more than one line@}.

4. Now we test the construct with non-text following it.
   @{@<sloth@>@}
@A@<Error Recovery Point@>
   @{     @>   @}
@A@<Error Recovery Point@>

5. Test the legal use of the @/emphasis@/ construct.

6.Test @/@/ (illegal).
@A@<Error Recovery Point@>

7. Test the construct @/across
   more than one line@/.

8. Now we test the construct with non-text following it.
   @/@<sloth@>@/
@A@<Error Recovery Point@>
   @/     @<   @/
