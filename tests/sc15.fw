SC15: Test that certain attributes are saved across inclusions.

1. Maximum input line length.
2. Special character.
3. Local line number.

To test this, we first set the first two attributes away from the
default. This will enable us to be sure that when they are restored that
they are being restored to their former values and not just set to the
default.

@=*   *! Change the special character.
*p maximum_input_line_length = 75

Before include.
*i sc15a
After include.

If the maximum input line length has been correctly restored then the
second of the following two lines should give an error, but not the first.
123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345
1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456

If the special character has been preserved, then the following should
generate an error.

*   - This should generate an error if all is well.

Preservation of the local line number can be checked by looking at the
listing file.
