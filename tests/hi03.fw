HI03: This example shows how FunnelWeb's macro facility can be used to
      fudge conditionals. This method is different to HI02.

@A@<Debug Macro@>

The following macro determines whether debug code will be included in the
program. All debug code is wrapped by a call to this macro and so
we can turn all the debug code on or off here by defining this macro to be
either empty or its parameter.

@$@#D@(@1@)@M==@{@1@}     @! Turns the debug code ON.
@! Use this definition to turn the debug code OFF: @$@#D@(@1@)==@{@}

while sloth<walrus loop
   @#D@(assert(sloth<walrus,"AWK! sloth>=walrus!!!!!!!");
        assert(timer<timermax,"AWK! timer>=timermax!!!");@)
   inc(sloth);
end loop@}
