Generate.Web
============
Some of the FunnelWeb tests require input files that contain control
characters, improperly terminated lines, and other special constructs
designed to test FunnelWeb's capacity to deal with anything that could
arise in an input text file.

Unfortunately, by their very nature, these constructs tend to be vulnerable
to file transfer programs and other utilities (e.g. FIXEOLS!) that take it
upon themselves to "fix up" various problems with text files.

The solution adopted here is to totally avoid the problem by using FunnelWeb
itself to generate these awkward test files. The following output file
macro definitions achieve this.

This FunnelWeb file should be fed into FunnelWeb before testing begins.

@!------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@O@<sc06.fw@>==@{@-
SC06: Test FunnelWeb on a file whose last line is not terminated properly
with an end of line marker.

Here is the improper termination!---->@}

@!------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@O@<sc08.fw@>==@{@-
SC08: Detection of trailing spaces.

This line has zero  trailing spaces |
This line has one   trailing space  | @+@-
This line has two   trailing spaces |  @+@-
This line has three trailing spaces |   @+@-
@}

@!------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@O@<sc09.fw@>==@{@-
SC09: Detection of control characters.

SC09.1 Test that control characters are detected and replaced by "?".
SC09.2 Test non printable that has a mnemonic.

There is a tab between these two bars |@^D(009)| which should come out as "?".
The above error message should contain the mnemonic "HT".

SC09.3 Test non printable that has no mnemonic.

There is a non-mnemonic control character between these bars |@^D(234)|.
@}

@!------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@O@<sc13e.fwi@>==@{@-
This is the include file for test SC13e. The test is to see how FunnelWeb
copes with an include file that has an improperly terminated last line.

Here is the improper termination!---->@}
