HI04: This example shows how FunnelWeb's macro facility can be used to
      fudge a multi-way conditional.

@O@<hi04.out@>==@{@<Main code@>@}

@A This module contains non-portable code that must execute on Hewlett
Packard, Sun, and DEC workstations. The following FunnelWeb macro is
defined to choose between these three. The first parameter is the HP code,
the second is the Sun code, and the third is the DEC code. Whichever
parameter constitutes the body of this macro determines which
machine the code is being targetted for.

@$@<Machine specific code@>@(@3@)@M==@{@1@}  @! Configure for HP.

@<Machine specific code@>@(
@"get_command_line(comline)@"           @, @! HP.
@"scan_command_line(128,comline);@"     @, @! Sun.
