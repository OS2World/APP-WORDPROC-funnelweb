EX11: This example shows how FunnelWeb typesets macros, typesetter commands
      and free text.

You are reading some free text before the macro. Free text can consist
of any text (not containing the FunnelWeb special character) including
typesetter commands
such as $, %, #, and \TeX{} which
will be typeset to appear exactly as they do in the input file!
Look out! Here comes a macro!

@O@<ex11.out@>==@{@-
This text is part of
a macro definition.
@}

This is free text following the macro. This sentence contains
two @{inline@} typesetter @/directives@/.
Now here is a non-inline typesetting directive.

@t new_page

This sentence will appear on the next page.
