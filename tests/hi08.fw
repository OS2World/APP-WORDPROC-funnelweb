======================@#D@(============@,=========@)
This has been a very good year for The Very Big Corporation of America.
With your help, we have been able to successfully
@#D@(@"screw the customers for every cent they have@"@,
     @"knock the shareholders into submission to bring you lower prices@"@).
With gross earnings approaching six trillion dollars, we have been able to
@#D@(@"increase dividends@"@,
     @"lower prices@"@).
We expect to have an even better year next year.
