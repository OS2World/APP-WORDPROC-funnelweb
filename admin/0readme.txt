FUNNELWEB INSTALLATION
======================
Chapter 4 of the FunnelWeb User's Manual contains full installation
instructions for FunnelWeb in LaTeX format. Ideally you should print out
the entire FunnelWeb User's Manual and then read the installation chapter
for installation instructions. The LaTeX files for the User's Manual are in
fwdir/userman/

If you are in a hurry, print out fwdir/userman/u_ch4.tex in text form and
follow the instructions within.
